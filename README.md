## 🚀 superstore-data-pipeline

A Medallion Architecture data pipeline for the Superstore dataset using Mage ETL and Snowflake, with analytics and dashboards in Power BI


## Pipeline Overview

This project implements a **Medallion Architecture** workflow for transforming Superstore sales data:

1. **CSV Source (Bronze layer)** – Raw sales data from Superstore.
2. **Transformations (Silver layer)** – Data cleaning, deduplication, and standardization in Mage.
3. **Gold Layer (modeled tables)** – Analytics-ready tables modeled in Mage and loaded into Snowflake. 
4. **Visualization** – Power BI dashboards connect to Snowflake to generate insights from Gold tables.

 ##  Key Technologies
| Component | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| **Orchestration / ETL** | Mage AI |
| **Storage Source** | CSV |
| **Data Warehouse** | Snowflake |
| **Data Modeling** | Medallion Architecture (Gold Layer) |
| **Visualization** | Power BI |

## 📊 Gold Layer Data Model 
The Gold Layer is designed using a Star Schema to ensure optimal query performance for Power BI.
The Gold layer contains dimensional and fact tables created in Mage AI.

- dim_customers
- dim_products
- dim_dates
- fact_sales

These tables are modeled in Mage (Transform blocks) and loaded to Snowflake.

## 📈 Visualization and Business Insights (Power BI)
The Power BI report is configured to connect directly to the cleaned and modeled tables in Snowflake.

Platform: Microsoft Power BI Desktop / Service

Data Source: Snowflake Data Warehouse.

Before opening, configure the Snowflake connection with your own credentials.

- Server: <YOUR_ACCOUNT>.snowflakecomputing.com  
- Warehouse: YOUR_WAREHOUSE  
- Database: YOUR_DATABASE
- Schema: YOUR_SCHEMA  
- User / Password: YOUR_CREDENTIALS

Connection Mode: Import Mode

note: data is refreshed daily/hourly, providing fast dashboard performance.

## Core Insights and Metrics
The dashboard is designed to answer the following core business questions:

1. Profitability Analysis: Tracks Profit Margin and Return on Investment (ROI) by region and product category.

2. Sales Trends: Monitors month-over-month and year-over-year Sales Growth and volume.

3. Customer Performance: Identifies top customers and measures sales by customer segment.

4. Operational Efficiency: Tracks the average time from Order Date to Ship Date.

## 🛠️ 1. Setup and Installation

Prerequisites: 

Python 3.10+

Docker and Docker Compose 

Snowflake Account Access (Role and Warehouse permissions)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IbtsamGhreeb/superstore-data-pipeline.git
    cd superstore-data-pipeline
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
NOTE:
 You DO NOT need to install these if using Mage Cloud or the Mage Docker image.
 Mage already includes these dependencies.
 This file is only for optional local development without Docker.

4.  **Start Mage AI (using Docker):**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    *This command will start the Mage server and all required services.*

5.  **Access Mage UI:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:6789`.
